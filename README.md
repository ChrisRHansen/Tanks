# Tanks

A 2-player game I made using Unity to practice and learn how to use the software to make a functional game.

Player 1 controls their tank using the wasd keys and shoots by pressing or holding spacebar. 
Player 2 controls their tank using the array keys and shoots by pressing or holding the enter button.

This repo includes the project files if one wishes to open it with unity, however there is a pre-built copy of the game inside of Tanks/Tanks_Release.
